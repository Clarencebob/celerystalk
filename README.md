# celerystalk

celerystalk helps you automate your network scanning/enumeration process with asynchronous jobs (aka *tasks*) while retaining full control of which tools you want to run.

## What celerystalk can automate for you

Phase | Command | Examples of tools used
--- | --- | ----
DNS Recon/Enumeration | ./celerystalk subdomains -d domain1,domain2 | Amass, sublist3r
Define Scope, Import nmap/nessus | ./celerystalk import [scan_data,scope_files,etc.] | celerystalk     
Port Scanning | ./celerystalk nmap | nmap
Directory and File Enumeration, Vulnerability Identification | ./celerystalk scan | Gobuster, Nikto, Photon, sqlmap, wpscan, hydra, medusa, wappalyzer, whatweb, etc.
Screenshots | ./celerystalk sceenshots | Aquatone
Analysis | ./celerystalk report | celerystalk

---
celerystalk is: 

* **Configurable** - Some common tools are in the default config, but you can add any tool you want
* **Service Aware** - Uses Nmap/Nessus service names rather than port numbers to decide which tools to run 
* **Scalable** - Designed for scanning multiple hosts, but works well for scanning one host at a time
* **VirtualHosts** - Supports subdomain recon and virtualhost scanning
* **Job Control** - Supports canceling, pausing, and resuming of tasks, inspired by Burp scanner
* **Screenshots** - Screenshots (aquatone) every in-scope URL that was identified by any tool (you can limit # of screenshots if you'd like)
---


## Install/Setup

* **Supported Operating Systems:** Kali 
* **Supported Python Version:** 2.x

**You must install and run celerystalk as root**   

```
# git clone https://github.com/sethsec/celerystalk.git
# cd celerystalk/setup
# ./install.sh
# cd ..
# ./celerystalk -h
```


## Using celerystalk - The basics


### [URL Mode] - How to scan a a URL (or multiple URLs in a file) 

#### Launch all enabled tools against a URL or many URLs in a file without having to import scope, nmap, etc. 
```
# ./celerystalk scan -u url or filename                 # Run all enabled commands against specified url(s)
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)               # Wait for scans to finish
# ./celerystalk screenshots                             # Take screenshots
# ./celerystalk report                                  # Generate report
```

### [CTF/HackTheBox/Easy mode] - How to scan one or more hosts

#### Import nmap xml
```
# nmap 10.10.10.10 -Pn -p- -sV -oX tenten.xml           # Run nmap
# ./celerystalk import -f tenten.xml                    # Import nmap scan 
```
#### Or, import list of hosts that are in scope and have celerystalk run nmap for you
```
# ./celerystalk import -S scope.txt                     # Import IP/CIDR/Ranges and mark as in scope
# ./celerystalk nmap                                    # Nmap all in-scope hosts (reads options from config.ini)
```

#### Check imported services, launch scans, take screenshots, generate report  
```
# ./celerystalk db services                             # If you want to see what services were loaded
# ./celerystalk scan                                    # Run all enabled commands
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)               # Watch scans as move from pending > running > complete
# ./celerystalk screenshots                             # Take screenshots
# ./celerystalk report                                  # Generate report
```

## Advanced Usage: Bug Bounty Mode vs Vulnerability Assessment Mode

You define the mode at workspace instantiation. The default workspace is VAPT mode, but you have two options for manually 
created workspaces.

* If you are starting with in scope IP addresses/ranges/CIDRs, use Vulnerability Assessment and PenTest (VAPT) mode.
* If you are starting with in scope domains, use Bug Bounty (BB) mode. 

### [Bug Bounty Mode] 

*  In BB mode, all subdomains found with celerystalk or manually imported are marked in scope.

#### Find subdomains, define out of scope hosts, scan everything else  

```
# ./celerystalk workspace create -o /dir -m bb          # Create default workspace and set output dir
# ./celerystalk subdomains -d company.com,dom.net       # Find subdomains and determine if in scope
# ./celerystalk import -S scope.txt     (optional)      # Import IP/CIDR/Ranges and mark as in scope
# ./celerystalk import -O out_scope.txt (optional)      # Define HOSTS/IPs that are out of scope
# ./celerystalk nmap                    (optional)      # Nmap all in-scope hosts (reads options from config.ini)
# ./celerystalk import -f client.xml    (optional)      # If you would rather import an nmap file you already ran
# ./celerystalk scan [--noIP]                           # Run all enabled commands against all in scope hosts
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)               # Wait for scans to finish
# ./celerystalk screenshots                             # Take screenshots
# ./celerystalk report                                  # Generate report
```
**Note:**  You can run the subdomains command first and then define scope, or you can define scope and import subdomains.



### [Vulnerability Assessment Mode]  

* In VAPT mode, IP addresses/ranges/CIDRs define scope.
* Subdomains that match an in-scope IP are also added to scope.

#### Import nmap scan, optionally define IPs or hostnames that are out of scope
```
# nmap -iL inscope-list.txt -Pn -p- -sV -oX client.xml     # Run nmap
# ./celerystalk workspace create -o /dir -m vapt           # Create default workspace and set output dir
# ./celerystalk import -f client.xml                       # Import services and mark all hosts as in scope
# ./celerystalk import -S scope.txt             (optional) # Import IP/CIDR/Ranges and mark as in scope
# ./celerystalk import -O out_scope.txt         (optional) # Define HOSTS/IPs that are out of scope
# ./celerystalk import -d subdomains.txt        (optional) # Define subdomains that are in scope
# ./celerystalk subdomains -d dom1.com,dom2.net (optional) # Find subdomains and determine if in scope
# ./celerystalk scan                                       # Run all enabled commands
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)                  # Wait for scans to finish
# ./celerystalk screenshots                                # Take screenshots
# ./celerystalk report                                     # Generate report
```
**Note:** You can run the subdomains command first and then define scope, or you can define scope and import subdomains.  

#### Import list of hosts that are in scope and have celerystalk run nmap and parse results 
```
# ./celerystalk workspace create -o /dir -m vapt        # Create default workspace and set output dir
# ./celerystalk import -S client-inscope-list.txt       # Import IP/CIDR/Ranges and mark as in scope
# ./celerystalk import -O out_scope.txt      (optional) # Define HOSTS/IPs that are out of scope
# ./celerystalk nmap                                    # Nmap all in-scope hosts (reads options from config.ini)
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)               # Watch nmap scans as they move from pending > running > complete
# ./celerystalk subdomains -d client.com,client.net     # Find subdomains and determine if in scope
# ./celerystalk scan                                    # Run all enabled commands
# ./celerystalk query watch (then Ctrl+c)               # Watch scans as they move from pending > running > complete
# ./celerystalk screenshots                             # Take screenshots
# ./celerystalk report                                  # Generate report
```
**Note:** You can run the subdomains command first and then define scope, or you can define scope and import subdomains.

```

#### cancel/pause/resume 
Cancel/Pause/Resume any task(s) that are currently running or in the queue.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cancel | <ul><li>Canceling a running task will send a **kill -TERM**</li><li>Canceling a queued task* will make celery ignore it (uses celery's revoke).</li><li>Canceling all tasks* will kill running tasks and revoke all queued tasks.</li></ul>
| pause | <ul><li>Pausing a single task uses **kill -STOP** to suspend the process.</li><li>Pausing all tasks* attempts to *kill -STOP* all running tasks, but it is a little wonky and you mind need to run it a few times. It is possible a job completed before it was able to be paused, which means you will have a worker that is still accepting new jobs.</li></ul>
| resume | <ul><li>Resuming tasks* sends a **kill -CONT** which allows the process to start up again where it left off.</li></ul>|

```
Cancel/Pause/Resume Tasks:  ./celerystalk <verb> 5,6,10-20          #Cancel/Pause/Resume tasks 5, 6, and 10-20 from current workspace

|  Options   | Description                           |
| --- | --- |
| no options | Create report for all in-scope hosts that have been scanned |

```
Create Report:              ./celerystalk report                    #Create a report for all scanned hosts in current workspace
